# Multisite User Dashboard - React.js

## Overview

This project is a **custom React.js dashboard** designed for **WordPress Multisite** networks. It provides a seamless and user-friendly interface for managing e-commerce stores, specifically tailored for users with limited technical experience. The dashboard integrates with WordPress via REST API to allow store owners to efficiently manage their businesses.

üöÄ **Inspired by Salla**: This dashboard serves as a **foundational version** of the well-known **Salla** platform, enabling users to create and manage online stores with ease.

üåç **Arabic-Focused**: The project is specifically built for **Arabic-speaking users**, providing a localized experience that makes store management intuitive and accessible.

## Features

- **WordPress Multisite Integration**: Connects with a WordPress multisite backend to manage different stores.
- **Product & Order Management**: Enables users to create, edit, and manage products and orders easily.
- **Subscription-Based Access**: Restricts access and features based on the user's subscription plan.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Built with **React.js** and **TailwindCSS** for a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **State Management with Zustand**: Utilizes **Zustand** for lightweight and efficient state management.
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient data fetching and state management to ensure a fast and reliable dashboard.
- **Secure Authentication**: Uses JWT-based authentication for user login and session handling.

## Authentication & Access

The dashboard is accessed using a **token-based authentication system**. Users must include their authentication token (`t`) in the URL to log in automatically:

```
https://localhost/?t=YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

This ensures a seamless login experience without the need for a separate login page.

## WordPress Plugin Integration

A dedicated **WordPress plugin** has been developed to handle the **backend setup** for this dashboard. The plugin automates API integration, authentication, and data management for multisite networks. However, **this plugin is not included in this repository**.
